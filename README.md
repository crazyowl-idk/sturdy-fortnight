🧭 The Roadmap to Master UI/UX + Frontend

Let’s break this into four phases.

⚙️ Phase 1: Build Strong UI/UX Fundamentals (Now → 3 months)

Goal: Think like a designer.

Learn:

UI principles (color, typography, layout, hierarchy)

UX process (research → wireframe → prototype → test)

Design tools: Figma (master this)

How to make responsive layouts in Figma (desktop, tablet, mobile)

Project ideas:

Redesign your faculty website

Create a “Student Dashboard” UI

Design a mobile app for campus events

💡 Output: 2–3 case studies on Behance/Notion.

💻 Phase 2: Learn Frontend Development (3–9 months)

Goal: Turn your Figma designs into real, working websites.

Start with:

HTML & CSS → learn structure + styling

Responsive Design (media queries, flexbox, grid)

JavaScript → interactivity (dropdowns, animations, popups)

Version Control (Git + GitHub)

Then, move to Frontend Frameworks:

🧱 React (most popular)

or simpler: Vue / Next.js later on

Project ideas:

Code your Figma design into a real site

Build a portfolio website

Create a simple web app (e.g., todo list, weather app)

💡 Output: 2–3 functional websites on GitHub + Netlify.

🧩 Phase 3: Combine Both — Product Mindset (1 year mark)

Goal: Blend design thinking + coding execution.

You’ll:

Create design systems (consistent components)

Code from Figma using real design tokens

Learn accessibility (usable for everyone)

Learn performance optimization

Collaborate using design-to-dev tools (Figma Inspect, Zeplin, Storybook)

💡 Output: One polished full project that’s designed + coded by you.
For example:

“CampusConnect” – a website where UM students share study materials and events.

That’s a portfolio-killer project.

☁️ Phase 4: Portfolio + Career Focus (Before internship)

Goal: Present yourself as a UI/UX-Frontend hybrid.

Create:

A portfolio website (coded by you, designed beautifully)

Write case studies that show your process (not just screenshots)

Keep projects on GitHub, Figma, and Behance

Join hackathons or design competitions
